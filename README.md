I noticed a bug where the constraint satisfaction wasn't working properly.  It was a silly mistake on my part.  Now the game chugs and chugs when executed because constraints are properly being applied and the game has to do more back tracking.  This isn't terribly surprising as a puzzle with no initial state has 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960 solutions.  That is, professionally speaking, a shit ton.  

With no application of heuristics the game is going to need some human help.  Clearly some code around setting the initial game state from user input should happen next. Before that though the whole thing needs to be refactored.  This program was written when I was learning go; I would make considerably different choices in how I structured this now that I've had a few years of go experience under my belt.
